# Bigram-Language-Model

This repo is to implement a Bigram Language Model with two version:

- From scrath version - which building step by step how the Bigram Model works.

  - The generated text from the scrath model version:

------

- Neural Network version - which build a simple neural network (with only one layer) but the result we get nearly the same with the above model, so I call it Neural Network version of Bigram Model.

  - The generated text from Neural Network model version:

------

The two model work nealy the same right? It help to figure out what Neural Network will work in order to generated text.
